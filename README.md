  <summary><b>What is the shared responsibility model?</b></summary>
  The Shared Responsibility Model in cloud computing, including Azure, defines the division of responsibilities between the cloud service provider (CSP) and the customer. It outlines which aspects of security and management are handled by the cloud provider and which are the responsibility of the customer. This model is crucial for ensuring a secure and well-managed cloud environment.
