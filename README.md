This Document has the purpose to create a collection of questions about Azure Fundamentals usable to understand how deeply you understood it.
_________________

# Usage

This document can be used to create a speech about the different Fundamentals areas of Azure. This process, hopefully, will lead to a self evaluation about the preparation for the **Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals**.
In this document will be presented different sections pertaining to the different areas of the Exam.
If you are determined to pass the exam, you should be able to describe Azure architectural components and Azure services, such as:

- Compute
- Networking
- Storage

You should also be able to describe features and tools to secure, govern, and administer Azure.
You should have skills and experience working with an area of IT, such as:

- Infrastructure management
- Database management
- Software development

In this document you will find the **Questions** used to recreate a speech about the Azure Fundamentals components, you should try it yourself, whenever you're stuck, is possible to check the answare that I propose. Let's start the journey!

# Here we start with the questions!
> **_NOTE_**: The questions will be divided in different sections depending on the subject.

> **_NOTE_**: The weight of each area in the exam is showed in the following table

| AZ-900 Domain Area                        | Weight   |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Describe cloud concepts                  | 25-30%   |
| Describe Azure architecture and services | 35-40%   |
| Describe Azure management and governance | 30-35%   |


## Introduction
<details>
  <summary><b>What is Azure?</b></summary>
  Azure, often referred to as Microsoft Azure, is a cloud computing platform provided by Microsoft. It offers a wide range of services, including computing power, storage, networking, databases, analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT), among others. Azure enables individuals and organizations to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through Microsoft's global network of data centers.

## Cloud computing
<details>
  <summary><b>What is Cloud Computing?</b></summary>
  Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>What is the shared responsibility model?</b></summary>
  The Shared Responsibility Model in cloud computing, including Azure, defines the division of responsibilities between the cloud service provider (CSP) and the customer. It outlines which aspects of security and management are handled by the cloud provider and which are the responsibility of the customer. This model is crucial for ensuring a secure and well-managed cloud environment.

You’ll always be responsible for:

- The information and data stored in the cloud
- Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
- The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

The cloud provider is always responsible for:

- The physical datacenter
- The physical network
- The physical hosts

Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:

- Operating systems
- Network controls
- Applications
- Identity and infrastructure

  <summary><b>Define Cloud models</b></summary>
  The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. The three main cloud models are: 
  - private 
  - public
  - hybrid
  
### Private cloud
A private cloud is, in some ways, the natural evolution from a corporate datacenter. It’s a cloud (delivering IT services over the internet) that’s used by a single entity. Private cloud provides much greater control for the company and its IT department. However, it also comes with greater cost and fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment. Finally, a private cloud may be hosted from your on site datacenter. It may also be hosted in a dedicated datacenter offsite, potentially even by a third party that has dedicated that datacenter to your company.

### Public Cloud
A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. With a public cloud, anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources. The general public availability is a key difference between public and private clouds.

### Hybrid Cloud
A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment. A hybrid cloud environment can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources. Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer of security. For example, users can flexibly choose which services to keep in public cloud and which to deploy to their private cloud infrastructure.

### Multi-Cloud
A fourth, and increasingly likely scenario is a multi-cloud scenario. In a multi-cloud scenario, you use multiple public cloud providers. Maybe you use different features from different cloud providers. Or maybe you started your cloud journey with one provider and are in the process of migrating to a different provider. Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

  <summary><b>How is the Cloud environment managed?</b></summary>
  ### Azure Arc
  Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment. Azure Arc can help manage your cloud environment, whether it's a public cloud solely on Azure, a private cloud in your datacenter, a hybrid configuration, or even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once.

<details>
  <summary><b>Describe the consumption-based model</b></summary>
  Operational Expenditure(OpEx) is spending money on services or products over time. Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.

Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model. With cloud computing, you don’t pay for the physical infrastructure, the electricity, the security, or anything else associated with maintaining a datacenter. Instead, you pay for the IT resources you use. If you don’t use any IT resources this month, you don’t pay for any IT resources.
This consumption-based model has many benefits, including:

- No upfront costs.
- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
- The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
- The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use.
Instead of maintaining CPUs and storage in your datacenter, you rent them for the time that you need them. The cloud provider takes care of maintaining the underlying infrastructure for you. The cloud enables you to quickly solve your toughest business challenges and bring cutting-edge solutions to your users.
